The playground book I have created for WWDC21 is called just Quiz. It is a recreation of an international television game show called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? The idea came during a pandemic situation when the whole education moved to the digital world, and my younger cousins started asking me to explain some topic. 

This playground can also provide support for a teacher to engage students with interactive study methods. But Quiz is not only for teachers. It can be used at work, at home - wherever you want.

The rule is straightforward. The goal is to get as many points as possible. At the beginning of the game, the players given three lives.  During the play, they can use lifelines to aid them with questions. It is 50/50, switch the question and ask the audience. For each incorrect answer, you will lose one life.

On the next page, you can modify a game or change a set of questions.

This submission is built 100% with SwiftUI, Combine framework, some visual assets from the vast SF Symbols library, and love.
